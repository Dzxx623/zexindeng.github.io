  <p>
    I am a Ph.D. researcher working at the intersection of <strong>wireless communications</strong> and
    <strong>connected &amp; collaborative robotics</strong>, with a focus on <strong>mobile telerobotics</strong>,
    <strong>network-aware teleoperation</strong>, and <strong>task-aware multi-view video streaming</strong> under
    dynamic 5G/6G network conditions.

  </p>

  <p>
    I am currently a <strong>Ph.D. student</strong> at
    <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/" target="_blank">the University of Warwick</a>,
    advised by Prof. <a href="http://www.zhenhuiyuan.net/" target="_blank">Zhenhui Yuan</a>
    and Prof. <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/eng/people/academics/subhashlakshminarayana/" target="_blank">Subhash Lakshminarayana</a>.
    My research aims to make teleoperation systems more <strong>robust, adaptive, and measurable</strong> by tightly coupling
    communication, perception, and control.
  </p>

  <p>
    I build <strong>network-aware testbeds and benchmark datasets</strong> for telerobotic applications, and develop
    <strong>task-aware streaming</strong> methods that protect task-critical viewpoints when uplink bandwidth fluctuates.
    Representative work includes <strong>TeleSim</strong>, a hardware-in-the-loop testbed and dataset that evaluates fine manipulation
    under controlled bandwidth/latency/jitter/packet-loss tiers, and <strong>TAMS</strong>, a task-aware multi-view streaming system
    that reallocates bitrate based on manipulation phases to improve visual fidelity and operational efficiency over 5G.

    interested in networked robotics, teleoperation, multi-view/immersive streaming, and communication-aware control
    (especially under 5G/6G, MEC, and dynamic uplink constraints). Feel free to reach out via email.
